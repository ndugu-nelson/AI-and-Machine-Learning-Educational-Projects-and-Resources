# **Machine Learning Projects**
This repository showcases a selection of projects designed for teaching Machine Learning through a product-based approach. Each project emphasizes hands-on learning by tackling real-life scenarios, which is integral to mastering data analysis, machine learning, and other data science skills. These projects are crafted to enhance practical knowledge and build expertise in the field.


### **Overview:**

- **README.md:**   Provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to navigate the files and directories.
- **SpaceXData_Preprocessing.ipynb:** A Jupyter notebook that contains data cleaning and preprocessing steps for a SpaceX dataset, focusing on preparing the data for further analysis and modeling. The SpaceX dataset features parameter that might prove necessarily for predicting successful or unsuccessful landing for SPace X  rockets.

### **How to Use:**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the methodology and approach used in each project.
