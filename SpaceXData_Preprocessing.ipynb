Identify and calculate the percentage of the missing values in each attribute.\n","\n","**NOTE:**\n","\n","Identifying and calculating the percentage of missing values in each attribute is crucial for several reasons:\n","\n","1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Understanding the extent of missing data helps assess the quality and reliability of the dataset. High percentages of missing values in certain attributes might indicate issues in data collection, which could affect the overall analysis.\n","\n","2. **Informed Decision-Making**: Knowing which attributes have missing values allows you to make informed decisions on how to handle them. You can choose to impute missing data, exclude those records, or even remove the attribute entirely, depending on the percentage of missing values and their impact on the analysis.\n","\n","3. **Model Performance**: Missing values can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models. Identifying these gaps early enables you to apply appropriate techniques to address them, ensuring that the models trained on the data are as accurate and robust as possible.\n","\n","4. **Pattern Detection**: The distribution of missing values can sometimes reveal patterns or biases in the data collection process. For example, if missing values are concentrated in certain attributes or correlated with specific variables, it could indicate underlying trends that are important for the analysis.\n","\n","5. **Data Imputation Strategies**: The percentage of missing values influences the choice of imputation methods. For example, a small percentage of missing values might be handled with simple techniques like mean or median imputation, while larger gaps might require more sophisticated methods like predictive modeling or data augmentation.\n","\n","6. **Regulatory Compliance**: In some fields, understanding and documenting missing data is essential for meeting regulatory standards. Accurately identifying and reporting the percentage of missing values ensures transparency and compliance with these requirements.\n","\n","By identifying and calculating the percentage of missing values, you lay the groundwork for cleaner, more accurate data analysis, ultimately leading to more reliable and actionable insights.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["FlightNumber       0.000\n","Date               0.000\n","BoosterVersion     0.000\n","PayloadMass        0.000\n","Orbit              0.000\n","LaunchSite         0.000\n","Outcome            0.000\n","Flights            0.000\n","GridFins           0.000\n","Reused             0.000\n","Legs               0.000\n","LandingPad        40.625\n","Block              0.000\n","ReusedCount        0.000\n","Serial             0.000\n","Longitude          0.000\n","Latitude           0.000\n","dtype: float64"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.isnull().sum()/df.count()*100"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Identify which columns are numerical and categorical:\n","\n","\n","Identifying which columns are numerical and categorical is an important step in data preprocessing for several reasons:\n","\n","1. **Appropriate Analysis Techniques**: Numerical and categorical data require different statistical and analytical techniques. Numerical data can be analyzed using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation, and can be used in regression models, while categorical data is analyzed using frequency counts, mode, and is suitable for classification models. Knowing the type of each column ensures that you apply the correct methods and tools for analysis.\n","\n","2. **Data Transformation and Encoding**: Categorical variables often need to be transformed into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding are used for this purpose. Identifying categorical columns allows you to choose the appropriate encoding method and prepare the data correctly for model training.\n","\n","3. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical data often requires scaling or normalization to ensure that features contribute equally to the model. Identifying numerical columns helps in applying scaling techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization. Proper scaling improves model performance by ensuring that numerical features are on a similar scale.\n","\n","4. **Model Selection and Performance**: Different machine learning models have varying requirements for input data types. For instance, linear regression and support vector machines work well with numerical data, while decision trees and random forests can handle both numerical and categorical data. Identifying the type of each column helps in selecting the appropriate model and tuning it effectively.\n","\n","5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The type of data (numerical or categorical) influences how you visualize and interpret the data. Numerical data might be visualized using histograms or scatter plots, while categorical data can be visualized with bar charts or pie charts. Identifying the type of each column ensures that you use the right visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights.\n","\n","6. **Handling Missing Values**: The strategy for handling missing values can differ based on the type of column. Numerical columns might use imputation techniques such as mean or median substitution, while categorical columns might use the mode or a placeholder category. Knowing the data types allows you to apply appropriate missing value treatment methods.\n","\n","7. **Feature Engineering**: Knowing which columns are numerical and categorical helps in feature engineering, such as creating interaction features or polynomial features for numerical data and grouping or binning categorical data. This enhances the ability to derive new insights and improve model performance.\n","\n","8. **Data Quality and Integrity**: Identifying the types of columns helps ensure data quality and integrity. For example, ensuring that numerical columns do not contain non-numeric values or that categorical columns do not have invalid categories.\n","\n","By clearly identifying numerical and categorical columns, you can tailor your data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling strategies to fit the nature of your data, leading to more accurate and meaningful results.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["FlightNumber        int64\n","Date               object\n","BoosterVersion     object\n","PayloadMass       float64\n","Orbit              object\n","LaunchSite         object\n","Outcome            object\n","Flights             int64\n","GridFins             bool\n","Reused               bool\n","Legs                 bool\n","LandingPad         object\n","Block             float64\n","ReusedCount         int64\n","Serial             object\n","Longitude         float64\n","Latitude          float64\n","dtype: object"]},"execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Challenge 1: Calculate the Number of Launches at Each Site\n","\n","In this challenge, you are tasked with calculating the number of launches that occurred at each SpaceX launch facility.
